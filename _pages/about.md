I am a first-year Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at [University of Washington](https://www.ece.uw.edu/), advised by [Prof. Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/). I'm broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I'm working on cross-modality learning, especially audio-visual learning.

Before my Ph.D. study, I received a Master of Science degree in Engineering from the University of Washington in 2021, [thesis option](https://www.proquest.com/pagepdf/2529292032?accountid=14784), specializing in [Data science and machine learning](https://www.me.washington.edu/research/research_areas/data-science-machine-learning).  In my master's degree, I closely worked with [Prof. Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/) and [Prof. Arka Majumdar](https://labs.ece.uw.edu/amlab/index.html) about Optical Neural Networks. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design Manufacturing and Automation ([MDMA](http://mve.cqu.edu.cn/jxyyzgcywb/Students/Undergraduate_Programs.htm)) at Chongqing University and closely cooperated with [National University of Singapore](http://mve.cqu.edu.cn/info/1318/4953.htm) in 2018. I received Summer School certificate from [Queen's Univeristy of Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/) in 2016.
