### **Work Experience**
**Research Internship**, Data & Data Science Group, [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com/en), 06/2023 ~ Now, Boston, MA 

Mentor: Wei Zhao and Bozhao Qi
- Data-Driven Neural-ODE Modeling for Breast Cancer Tumor Dynamics and Progression-Free Probability Predictions 
    - Managed sparse data from early phases of clinical trials and predicted later phases with only a single observation
    -	Created visualizations depicting various tumor dynamics patterns and achieved accurate predictions (R2 exceeding 0.9)
    -	Provided a robust reference for clinical trial design by identifying potential responders and progressed patients
- Unpaired Tissue Segmentation & Virtual Restaining 
    - Proposed an end-to-end unpaired segmentation GAN and virtual staining framework that mimics real staining processes
    - Supervised prior works and presented a promising substitute for traditional histopathology methods for clinical trial recruitment
